# Bug reporting

First and foremost, see `README.md` and other documentation in `doc`.
Common issues and solutions are also often discussed online.

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/veox/sgminer/issues) is there
specifically for reporting bugs, issues and proposed improvements. Other
communication channels are not regularly monitored.

Search the issue list to see if it has already been reported.

Information that is most often relevant:

* OS version;
* Catalyst driver version;
* AMD APP SDK version;
* AMD ADL version;
* GPUs used (`sgminer --ndevs`);
* whether you're using a pre-compiled binary or bult from source;
* `sgminer` version (`sgminer --version` and/or `git describe`);
* contents of the configuration file;
* launch procedure (manual or via script);
* steps to repeat;
* expected result;
* actual result;
* debug output (`sgminer --text-only --debug --verbose`).

It is preferred that large amounts of data be posted on external sites.
